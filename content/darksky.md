title: Dark-Sky
---

I'm an avid supporter for the dark-sky movement, with the goal of preserving the effectiveness of astronomical ground-based observations, the circadian rhythms of nocturnal animals, and the magical beauty of the night sky for generations of poets, musicians, scientists, artists, and dreamers!
As an official advocate for the [International Dark-Sky association (IDA)](https://www.darksky.org/), 
I'm working to educate those in my community about the subtle effects of light pollutiion and push for city-wide lighting reform.

Feel free to visit the IDA website or connect with me on LinkedIn if you'd like to learn more about the cause!
